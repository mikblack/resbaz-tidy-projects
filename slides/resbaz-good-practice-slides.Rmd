## Reproducibility + Efficiency + Continuity

 - For you:
    - recreate results (with ease)
    - reuse code and workflows
    - develop more efficient work habits
    
 - For everyone:
    - ensure reproducibility (and reduce burden)
    - establish workflows
    - enable collaboration
    - build upon existing work

# Quiz time...

## Not really, just some thinking

Spend two minutes thinking about the answers to the following questions:

1. If you were abducted by aliens in the next 30 seconds, how easy would it be for someone else to carry on your research? (after we finished mourning your loss, of course).

2. How much time would you need to spend getting your work to the point where another human being *could* carry on with your project?  What would this involve?

3. If you laptop/desktop was unexpectedly destroyed by evil anti-research forces, what impact would this have on your project? (it's ok, we'll buy you a shiny new one from our "anti-anti-research forces" insurance fund).

# Lets (briefly) discuss your answers...

## Overview

Sections:

 - Data Management
 - Software
 - Collaboration
 - Project Organization
 <!-- - Keeping Track of Changes -->
 <!-- - Manuscripts -->
 <!-- - Ten Rules for Reproducible Computational Research -->

## Data management

 1. Save the raw data.
    - preserve raw data - never edit
    - if needed, computationally create modified versions of raw data (e.g., data cleaning).
    
 2. Ensure raw data are backed up in more than one location
    - NeSI + host institution (i.e., "remote" storage)
    - Data sensitivity issues with cloud-based storage providers
    
 3. Create the data you wish to see in the world
    - non-proprietary formats
    - informative variable and file names
    - make it the data set you wished you had received...

## Data management
 
<ol start=4>
<li> Create analysis-friendly data

- each column is a variable
- each row is an observation
- tidy data aren't just for R...

<li> Record all the steps used to process data.

- use scripts to capture (and automate) every step of data processing and cleaning

</ol>

## Data management
 
<ol start=6>

<li> Anticipate the need to use multiple tables, and use a unique identifier for every record.

  - e.g., multiple CSV files linked by a common sample ID
  - combine data programmatically 

<li> Submit data to a reputable DOI-issuing repository so that others can access and cite it.

 - Zenodo: https://zenodo.org
 - Dryad: https://datadryad.org
 - FigShare: https://figshare.com
 
<p style="color:red">**But first: CAN you share your data?**</p>

</ol>

## Software (scripts, code etc)

1. Place a brief explanatory comment at the start of every program.
  
    - explain what the code does, and how to use it.
    - if approriate, include example of usage.
  
2. Decompose programs into functions.
 
    - breaks tasks into small (well-documented) chunks
    - digestible => understandable
  
3. Be ruthless about eliminating duplication.
 
    - use functions
    - don't copy and paste code chunks (write a function)
 
## Software (scripts, code etc)
 
<ol start=4> 
 
<li> Always search for well-maintained software libraries that do what you need.

  - don't reinvent the wheel...
 
<li> Test libraries before relying on them.
 
<li> Give functions and variables meaningful names.

  - use tab completion with informative names
 
<li> Make dependencies and requirements explicit.

  - can be as simple as adding a `requirements.txt` file.

</ol>

## Software (scripts, code etc)
 
<ol start=8> 

<li> Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to control a program's behavior.

  - error prone
  - use `if/else` statements instead
 
<li> Provide a simple example or test data set.

  - also good for you to help with testing
  - and great for running workshops!

<li> Submit code to a reputable DOI-issuing repository.

</ol>

# Even if you are not working as part of a team...<BR><BR>...YOU ARE!!

## Collaboration 

 - Your project is very likely to be part of a larger research programme, and the work you are doing has the potential to contribute to other projects in the future.
 
 - You are also collaborating with yourself: ask "present Murray" about his good friend "future Murray".
 
## Collaboration 

1. Create an overview of your project.

    - `README.txt` or `README.md` in top-level directory
    
2. Create a shared "to-do" list for the project.

    - even if it is just for you...

3. Decide on communication strategies.

4. Make the license explicit.

5. Make the project citable.


# Quiz Time...

## Whose project folder looks like this?

## Find a partner...

 - Spend two minutes discussing how you organise your projects.
 - Think about:
    - directory structure
    - documentation
    - where different types of files are kept

# This stuff is critical...

## Project Organisation 

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.

2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.

3. Put raw data and metadata in a data directory and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
 
    - critical to separate input data from derived data
    - don't be afraid to use subdirectories to impose additional order
 
## Project Organisation 

<ol start=4>  
 
<li> Put project source code in the src directory.
 
  - Interpreted: R, Python
  - Compiled: C++, Fortran, Java
  - Shell scripts, SQL snippets
  
  For small projects, include a "runall" script.  For example:
  
  ```
  TEMP_DIR = ./temp_zip_files
  echo "Packaging zip files required by analysis tool…"
  mkdir $(TEMP_DIR)
  ./src/make-zip-files.py $(TEMP_DIR) *.dat
  echo "Analyzing…"
  ./bin/sqr_mean_analyze -i $(TEMP_DIR) -b "temp"
  echo "Cleaning up…"
  rm -rf $(TEMP_DIR)
  ```
  
</ol>

## Project Organisation 

<ol start=5> 

<li> Put external scripts or compiled programs in the bin directory.

  - may not be relevant for some projects (e.g., if not using compiled code)
  - why external scripts here? Can make distinction for edited vs non-edited files: binary files and external scripts are not directly edited.

<li> Name all files to reflect their content or function.

 - Please do this.
 
</ol>

<!-- ## Keeping Track of Changes -->

<!--  - The "Good Enough Practice" authors offer two methods for tracking changes: -->
<!--     - Manual versioning -->
<!--     - Version control systems (e.g., Git/GitHub, Subversion, Mercurial) -->
<!--  - GA <span style="color:red">**STRONGLY**</span> recommends version control via Git and GitHub. -->
<!--     - repositories can be private if needed. -->
<!--     - even limited sharing (e.g., within GA) helps reinforce good practice in terms of oragnisation and documentation. -->
<!--     - a tidy and well-maintained GitHub account is a huge asset when applying for jobs... -->

<!-- ## Keeping Track of Changes -->

<!--  1. Back up (almost) everything created by a human being as soon as it is created. -->

<!--  2. Keep changes small. -->

<!--  3. Share changes frequently. -->

<!--  4. Create, maintain, and use a checklist for saving and sharing changes to the project. -->

<!--  5. Store each project in a folder that is mirrored off the researcher's working machine. -->

<!-- <font size="4"> -->
<!--  ~~6. Add a file called CHANGELOG.txt to the project's docs subfolder.~~ -->

<!--  ~~7. Copy the entire project whenever a significant change has been made.~~ -->
<!-- </font> -->

<!-- <ol start=8>  -->

<!-- <li> <span style="color:red">**Use a version control system.**</span> -->

<!-- </ol> -->

<!-- <font size="2"> -->
<!-- No need for 6 and 7 if version control system used. -->
<!-- </font> -->

<!-- ## Manuscripts  -->

<!--  1. Write manuscripts using online tools with rich formatting, change tracking, and reference management. -->

<!--     - e.g., Google Docs  -->
<!--     - all edits saved in single place online -->
<!--     - no need to merge versions -->

<!-- **OR** -->

<!-- <ol start=2>  -->

<!-- <li> Write the manuscript in a plain text format that permits version control. -->

<!--   - e.g., LaTeX, Markdown -->
<!--   - online/collaborative: Overleaf, Authorea -->

<!-- </ol> -->

<!-- # A few more suggestions... -->

<!-- ## Ten Rules for Reproducible Computational Research -->

<!--  - Rule 1: For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced -->

<!--  - Rule 2: Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps -->

<!--  - Rule 3: Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used -->

<!--  - Rule 4: Version Control All Custom Scripts -->

<!--  - Rule 5: Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats -->

<!-- ## Ten Rules for Reproducible Computational Research -->

<!--  - Rule 6: For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random Seeds -->

<!--  - Rule 7: Always Store Raw Data behind Plots -->

<!--  - Rule 8: Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of Increasing Detail to Be Inspected -->

<!--  - Rule 9: Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results -->

<!--  - Rule 10: Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results -->

<!-- ## Reproducible Computational Research -->

<!--  - The "Ten Rules" article is a little dated now -->
<!--  - "Reproducible Research" concepts and tools are now much more  -->
<!--  a part of our standard practice: -->
<!--     - Jupyter notebooks -->
<!--     - R markdown -->
<!--     - Workflow languages (Snakemake, CWL, NextFlow) -->
<!--  - If you are not routinely using at least some of these tools in your work, then you are missing out a huge productivity boost. -->
<!--  - And if you don't know how to get started in this space - get in touch with us, and we'll point you in the right direction. -->
 
# Closing thoughts... 
 
## Tools and habits

 - Tools **enable** reproducible research
    - there are lots of them
    - they are not hard to learn

 - Good habits **ensure** reproducible research
    - there are many good habits: each one will improve your work in some way
    - these **are** hard to learn (actually, that is not true - it is just hard to **unlearn** your bad habits)
 - Getting into the habit of using these "good practice tools" as a central part of your workflow is critical
 - It takes commitment, but it will be hugely beneficial
